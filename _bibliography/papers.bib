abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests as a complex systems pathology with intricate interplay among various genes and biological processes. Traditional differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, while commonly employed to characterize AD-driven perturbations, does not sufficiently capture the full spectrum of underlying biological processes. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from postmortem brain samples across key regions—middle temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex-we provide a comprehensive systematic analysis of disrupted processes in AD. We go beyond the DEG-centric analysis by integrating pathway activity analysis with weighted gene co-expression patterns to comprehensively map gene interconnectivity, identifying region- and cell-type-specific drivers of biological processes associated with AD. Our analysis reveals profound modular heterogeneity in neurons and glia as well as extensive AD-related functional disruptions. Co-expression networks highlighted the extended involvement of astrocytes and microglia in biological processes beyond neuroinflammation, such as calcium homeostasis, glutamate regulation, lipid metabolism, vesicle-mediated transport, and TOR signaling. We find limited representation of DEGs within dysregulated pathways across neurons and glial cells, suggesting that differential gene expression alone may not adequately represent the disease complexity. Further dissection of inferred gene modules revealed distinct dynamics of hub DEGs in neurons versus glia, suggesting that DEGs exert more impact on neurons compared to glial cells in driving modular dysregulations underlying perturbed biological processes. Interestingly, we observe an overall downregulation of astrocyte and microglia modules across all brain regions in AD, indicating a prevailing trend of functional repression in glial cells across these regions. Notable genes from the CALM and HSP90 families emerged as hub genes across neuronal modules in all brain regions, suggesting conserved roles as drivers of synaptic dysfunction in AD. Our findings demonstrate the importance of an integrated, systems-oriented approach combining pathway and network analysis to comprehensively understand the cell-type-specific roles of genes in AD-related biological processes.}},

title = {{Upregulated Ca2+ Release from the Endoplasmic Reticulum Leads to Impaired Presynaptic Function in Familial Alzheimer’s Disease}},

abstract = {{Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals is primarily regulated by rapid Ca2+ influx through membrane-resident voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is extensively present in axonal terminals of neurons and plays a modulatory role in synaptic transmission by regulating Ca2+ levels. Familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) is marked by enhanced Ca2+ release from the ER and downregulation of Ca2+ buffering proteins. However, the precise consequence of impaired Ca2+ signaling within the vicinity of VGCCs (active zone (AZ)) on exocytosis is poorly understood. Here, we perform in silico experiments of intracellular Ca2+ signaling and exocytosis in a detailed biophysical model of hippocampal synapses to investigate the effect of aberrant Ca2+ signaling on neurotransmitter release in FAD. Our model predicts that enhanced Ca2+ release from the ER increases the probability of neurotransmitter release in FAD. Moreover, over very short timescales (30–60 ms), the model exhibits activity-dependent and enhanced short-term plasticity in FAD, indicating neuronal hyperactivity—a hallmark of the disease. Similar to previous observations in AD animal models, our model reveals that during prolonged stimulation ({\textasciitilde}450 ms), pathological Ca2+ signaling increases depression and desynchronization with stimulus, causing affected synapses to operate unreliably. Overall, our work provides direct evidence in support of a crucial role played by altered Ca2+ homeostasis mediated by intracellular stores in FAD.}},
