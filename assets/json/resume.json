Our findings revealed the significant role of trial history in explaining the trial-to-trial variability of behavioral and neural responses at stimulus onset. These findings challenged the common notion that variability in neural and behavioral data is often regarded as noise. This research experience further strengthened my skills in machine learning and understanding the complex dynamics of neural and behavioral responses.",
