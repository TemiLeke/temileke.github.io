The bulk of the work in this phase is centred around conducting an integrated analysis of snRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data from AD brains to reveal how molecular network alterations translate to functional impairments of cellular processes driving AD pathogenesis.

We employed high-dimensional Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis (hdWGCNA), a framework tailored to handle the sparsity in single-cell transcriptomics data. As a result, we uncovered We identified distinct co-expression modules for each cell-type ithin each brain region, along with hub genes likely playing pivotal regulatory roles due to their extensive module interactions. For instance, in the MTG, we found differentially expressed hub genes (hub-DEGs) like MT-CO1, CALM2,WASF1, concentrated in specific modules, which indicates dysregulation of key pathways like mitochondrial function, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Surprisngly, only a few glial modules displayed enrichment for hub-DEGs, suggesting a more limited role of DEGs in orchestrating pathway perturbations in glial cells. However, several modules contained AD-related hub genes such as, APOE, CLU, CST3, CD81, and Solute Carrier (SLC) family genes, associated with critical glial functions, such as glutamate regulation, synaptic plasticity, and microglial activation states.</p> <p>Further analysis of recurrent hub genes across brain regions suggested potential conserved genes driving the observed pathway perturbations in each cell type. For example, excitatory neurons showed substantial overlap in hub genes like ACTB, CALM1/2, GAPDH, HSP90AB1, and UCHL1, participating in critical processes like Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation, autophagy, and synaptic function. Most overlapping hub genes were non-DEGs that co-expressed in similar modules across regions, reinforcing the notion that coordinated network-level dysregulation, rather than changes in individual genes, mediates pathway perturbations.</p> <hr> <h3 id="2-mapping-glia-neuron-signaling-mechanisms-propagating-alzheimers-disease-associated-pathway-dysregulations"><strong>2. Mapping glia-neuron signaling mechanisms propagating Alzheimerâ€™s disease-associated pathway dysregulations.</strong></h3> <p>Our current work builds on the findings outline above to take a deeper look into the complex interactions between glial cells and neurons in AD. Here, we aim to map the glia-neuron signaling mechanisms that propagate AD-associated pathway dysregulations, with a particular focus on astrocyte-glutamatergic neuron signaling at tripartite synapses.</p> <p>This work arises due to emerging evidence demonstrating the critical roles of non-neuronal cells, particularly astrocytes and microglia, in the pathological mechanisms underlying nueronal dysfunction in AD progression. Our previous work (outlined above) revealed that in AD, these glial cells exhibit reactive signatures along with significant perturbations of associated regulatory programs. These perturbations have the potential to propagate molecular alterations from glia to neurons, and as a result, contribute to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. However, the precise glia-neuron mechanisms underlying these disrupted signaling processes remain poorly defined, and the extent to which they represent cell-autonomous versus non-cell autonomous effects, remain poorly defined.</p> <p>To address this gap, we will apply three complementary systems-level strategies which crucially include scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq that cannot be further discussed here to avoid being scooped. Nonetheless, weâ€™re positive our approach will allow us to delineate whether pathway disruptions emerge from cell-autonomous mechanisms (originating within the affected cell type) or non-cell autonomous effects (resulting from dysfunctional signaling between cell types). For instance, we anticipate finding examples of how glial signaling disruptions trigger downstream pathway dysregulation and synaptic dysfunction in neurons during AD progression, representing non-cell autonomous effects. These might include altered glial activities, such as the expression of C1q proteins in disease-associated microglia and disrupted release of thrombospondins from astrocytes, which could initiate a cascade of synaptic pruning and excitotoxic processes through interactions with neuronal receptors.</p> <p>We will then build on this to focus specifically on disrupted signaling at tripartite synapses between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons (an area of interest in the lab, for itâ€™s relevance in disorders like seizures and ischemia). Astrocytes play a pivotal role in regulating excitatory glutamate signaling and preventing excitotoxicity, but the precise molecular mechanisms enabling this regulation and how they become dysfunctional in AD are not sufficiently defined. Hence, to address this, we will analyze spatial transcriptomic data from AD and control postmortem tissue across multiple brain regions. This will enable high-resolution spatial mapping of DEGs, ligand-receptor pairs, and dysregulated pathways specifically at tripartite synapse interaction sites. We hypothesize that AD induces pathological changes in critical astrocyte receptors, transporters, and channels that disrupt molecular coordination with neighboring glutamatergic neurons. Ultimately, integrating evidence on localized dysfunctional signaling interactions from spatial omics with results from cell-cell communication from sequencing data, will provide a more robust understanding of the disrupted signaling between astrocytes and neurons that drive excitotoxicity in AD. ***</p> </article> <h2>References</h2> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/adeoye_systematic_2024-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/adeoye_systematic_2024-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/adeoye_systematic_2024-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/adeoye_systematic_2024.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="adeoye_systematic_2024.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> </div> <div id="adeoye_systematic_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Systematic Analysis of Biological Processes Reveals Gene Co-expression Modules Driving Pathway Dysregulation in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease</div> <div class="author"> <em>Temitope Adeoye</em>,Â Syed I.

Traditional differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, while commonly employed to characterize AD-driven perturbations, does not sufficiently capture the full spectrum of underlying biological processes. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from postmortem brain samples across key regionsâ€”middle temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex-we provide a comprehensive systematic analysis of disrupted processes in AD. We go beyond the DEG-centric analysis by integrating pathway activity analysis with weighted gene co-expression patterns to comprehensively map gene interconnectivity, identifying region- and cell-type-specific drivers of biological processes associated with AD. Our analysis reveals profound modular heterogeneity in neurons and glia as well as extensive AD-related functional disruptions. Co-expression networks highlighted the extended involvement of astrocytes and microglia in biological processes beyond neuroinflammation, such as calcium homeostasis, glutamate regulation, lipid metabolism, vesicle-mediated transport, and TOR signaling. We find limited representation of DEGs within dysregulated pathways across neurons and glial cells, suggesting that differential gene expression alone may not adequately represent the disease complexity. Further dissection of inferred gene modules revealed distinct dynamics of hub DEGs in neurons versus glia, suggesting that DEGs exert more impact on neurons compared to glial cells in driving modular dysregulations underlying perturbed biological processes. Interestingly, we observe an overall downregulation of astrocyte and microglia modules across all brain regions in AD, indicating a prevailing trend of functional repression in glial cells across these regions. Notable genes from the CALM and HSP90 families emerged as hub genes across neuronal modules in all brain regions, suggesting conserved roles as drivers of synaptic dysfunction in AD. Our findings demonstrate the importance of an integrated, systems-oriented approach combining pathway and network analysis to comprehensively understand the cell-type-specific roles of genes in AD-related biological processes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> Â© Copyright 2024 Temitope
