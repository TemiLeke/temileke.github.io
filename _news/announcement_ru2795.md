I will be giving a talk at the upcoming annual meeting of [Synapses Under Stress (RU 2795)](https://www.for2795.hhu.de/en/), hosted by [Prof. Jürgen Klingauf](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Cells-in-Motion/de/people/all/klingauf-j.php) at the University of Münster, Germany. My talk is titled **_<span style="color:orange">Alzheimer’s Disease-associated Intracellular Calcium Dyshomeostasis Leads to Impaired Presynaptic Function</span>_**, and I will share key results from the initial phases of my thesis, focusing on the cellular level disruptions associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in Familial Alzheimer’s Disease (FAD), including the effects of disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling on neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity in an in-silico model of FAD, and how Aβ-mediated cation pore formation modulates presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and the downstream effects on exocytosis in-silico.
