I'm a Physicist and PhD candidate in Computational Neurobiology at the University of South Florida, working in [Dr. Ghanim Ullah](http://faculty.cas.usf.edu/gullah/)'s lab. My research essentially revolves around looking at a bit of biology and seeing how it can be reduced to variables and equations. 

I currenlty lead projects that span genomics and biophysics, where I specically apply systems biology strategies to unravel the cell-type-specific mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. My work primarily involves: 
  - applying theoretical and computational tools/methods for problems in whole cell biophysics and
  - bioinformatics, network biology, and statistical methods for problems in single-cell genomics (scRNA-seq), epigenomics (scATAC-seq), and spatial transcriptomics. 

I recently interned on the Computational Biology team at [Cajal Neuroscience](https://www.cajalneuro.com/), where I developed Machine Learning pipelines for single-cell multi-omics data analysis to help guide the interpretation of experiments on in-house disease models for target prioritization in in-vivo/vitro screening platforms.

My current research interests are:

  - Computational biology for complex brain diseases and aging.
  - Machine learning applications in single-cell biology and drug discovery.
  - Bioinformatics methods and pipeline development.
