Hey there, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Physicist and PhD candidate in Computational Neurobiology at the University of South Florida, working in [Dr. Ghanim Ullah](http://faculty.cas.usf.edu/gullah/)'s lab. My research essentially revolves around looking at a bit of biology and seeing how it can be reduced to variables and equations. 

I currenlty lead projects across genomics and biophysics, where I specifically apply systems biology strategies to uncover the cell-type-specific mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. These methods primarily involve: 
  - Theoretical and computational tools/methods for problems in whole cell biophysics and
  - Bioinformatics, network biology, and statistical techniques for problems in single-cell genomics (scRNA-seq), epigenomics (scATAC-seq), and spatial transcriptomics. 

I recently interned on the Computational Biology team at [Cajal Neuroscience](https://www.cajalneuro.com/), where I developed Machine Learning pipelines for single-cell multi-omics data analysis to help guide the interpretation of experiments on in-house disease models for target prioritization in in-vivo/vitro screening platforms.

As a scientist, I'm broadly interested in all aspects of computational biology for complex brain diseases and aging, machine learning applications in single-cell biology and drug discovery, and development of bioinformatics methods and pipelines.
